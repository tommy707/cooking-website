    <h2>This cake is definitely something!</h2>
    <p>This cake is certainly edible and interesting looking. Now before we get to the recipe, let me tell you a little something about myself. My name is Cletus Bartholomew the third, and I was born at a gas station. The first words I ever said were, and I kid you not, "<em>Hawaiian Cake Recipe.</em>" My parents were not impressed. In all the years I have been alive, they have never shown me love.</p>
    <p>Let me tell you something. I learned to make this cake before I learned how to walk. It is very important to me, but today, I will be sharing the recipe with you. I hope you enjoy it more than my Mother does. She does <strong>NOT</strong> like my Hawaiian Cake Recipe. (Her name is Patricia.)</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of flour</li>
        <li>5 lemons</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>7 ounces of children tears</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>5 cups of sugar</li>
        <li>Hawaiian citizenship</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Icing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 bags icing sugar</li>
        <li>bucket of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Crack an egg in your mouth to ensure it is still fresh (It will taste nice). Then, crack remaining into bowl.</li>
        <li>Peel lemons and squeeze the juice into mixture. Don't lick your fingers as tempting as it is.</li>
        <li>Okay, you can lick your fingers a little.</li>
        <li>Panfry children tears before adding them to the mixture. They contain harmful bacteria if not cooked properly.</li>
        <li>Bake in oven for three hours at 700c.</li>
        <li>Combine icing ingredients and dollop on top.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Eat hot and enjoy. This will last up to a year in the fridge if you do not mind the mold... But it never lasts that long in my house. LOL!</p>
