    <h2>This pizza will be the only pizza you ever eat again!</h2>
    <p>The title above probably has you wondering... Gee, is this recipe really that good? The answer is maybe. One of my friends ate this recipe and shortly after passed away from unrelated causes, but you know what? It was the last pizza he ever ate. So if you, too, happen to die after consuming this pizza, you cannot tell me it is a misleading title, no?</p>
    <p><em>On an unrelated note, if you or a loved one are allergic to salmonella or pufferfish, please do not try this recipe. Otherwise enjoy!</em></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of flour</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>actually, 6 eggs</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 pufferfish</li>
        <li>5 cups of sugar</li>
        <li>ketchup</li>
        <li>cheese of your choosing</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough using your dry ingredients and 3 eggs. Save remaining eggs for later.</li>
        <li>Put a tomato in the pufferfish' mouth and laugh. It looks rather funny, doesn't it? Now retrieve the tomato and chop into chunks. </li>
        <li>Put the fish in the microwave for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ketchup onto the dough and crack remaining eggs on for flavor.</li>
        <li>Lightly season with 5 cups of sugar. It will contrast nicely with the acidity of the tomato.</li>
        <li>Smoosh the pufferfish into the dough and place in oven for 30 minutes at 360c.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy this slimy, delectable pizza with a beer and a movie. Perfect for any occasion.</p>
