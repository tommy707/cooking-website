    <h1>Do YOU love hot chocolate?!</h1>
    <p>Well, I loooove hot chocolate! I drink it on a Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday! But <strong>NEVER</strong> on a Wednesday.</p>
    <p>There is only <em>one</em> thing I don't really like about hot chocolate. You guessed it- <em>it is so darn hard to make.</em> When I get back from a grueling 3 hour workday, all I want to do is sit down and rest my poor, tired feet. I simply don't have the energy to follow <em>other websites recipes of hot chocolate.</em> So I decided to make my OWN recipe. Something that is simple, quick, and delicious. My name is Bartholomew and I'm glad to have you here!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>hot chocolate powder</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of water</li>
        <li>3 marshmallows</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of finely chopped dragon egg shell</li>
        <li>a block of pure gold</li>
        <li>dried unicorn droppings</li>
        <li>Half-life 3</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all ingredients to cup</li>
        <li>Run a marathon and come 1st</li>
        <li>Do seventy three pushups before drinking for maximum taste</li>
        <li>DO <strong>NOT</strong> drink on Wednesday.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
